# titanic-cleaned-first-attempt

This is my first step into the world of data handling/analysis and predictive modeling. Chose to begin with a widely recognized messy dataset - the Titanic  passenger list - as a challenge to apply my newly acquired foundational cleaning skills.

### Files included
- Titanic Dataset (original).csv
- titanic_dataset_cleaned.xlsx

### Actions performed (non-exhaustive)
-Removal of punctuation and spaces- to be code-friendly
-lowercased all text
-Name pasing into first, last, given name
-Created sub-groups like ["infant", "below 18", "adult","family size"]-for modeling / analysis
-Rename, split safety boat identifications and identify instances of multiple boat transfer - for modeling/analysis
-Standardizing ticker number format

### Known Issues
-Several missing values are not yet fully handled
-lack of consistency in handling boolean type information)

### Purpose of this
-Forms part of my learning journey in data cleaning & formatting
-First public portfolio entry with intenion to upload more repo as I progress along
